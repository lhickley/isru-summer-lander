# Mars Lander - ISRU Mission

A simple Mars landing game built for the ISRU Summer Camp challenge.

## Mission Objective
Successfully land your spacecraft on Mars to deploy In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) equipment!

## Controls
- Arrow Keys: Control thrusters
- Land softly to avoid mission failure

## ISRU Theme
This game simulates the critical landing phase of a Mars mission, where precise resource management (fuel) and skillful piloting are essential for mission success.

Just like Tom Sachs' philosophy of using available resources, you must make the most of your limited fuel to achieve a successful landing.
